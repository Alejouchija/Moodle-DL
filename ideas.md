# Ideas that are not yet implemented

1. Diff files that are modified and add the changes to the status mail.
	usage of git and pygments and pdf2text?
2. Tool to generate API URL's including the token 
3. Try to guess the section id and add it to the name, for better automatic sorting
4. Allow automatic deletion of files that are marked as deleted, moved or modified. Also delete empty directory after moving or deletion of files.
5. Download Forum entries. I already created a [wiki entry](https://github.com/C0D3D3V/Moodle-Downloader-2/wiki/Moodle-API---Forums)
